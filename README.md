## Scrum in CSE

Scrum is the most widely-known agile software engineering process, which makes is a great fit for CSE's globally distributed org, as well as our customer engagement model. Following a well-known process, for which innumberable books, blogs and training courses are available, makes it much easier for engineers from multiple teams and companies to form and quickly become productive.

## Scrum Reference
Scrum was first defined as a formal software engineering process in 1995 by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber.<sup>[1](#history)</sup> Sutherland and Schwaber have been actively speaking and writing about Scrum ever since.

Of particular note is [The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide), a freely available document (published under a Creative Commons license.<sup>[2](#license)</sup>), which is described by Sutherland & Schwaber as the official definition of Srum: 

>Scrum is defined completely in the Scrum Guide by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the originators of Scrum.  The Scrum Guide is maintained independently of any company or vendor and therefore lives on a brand neutral site.  The Scrum Guide is translated and available in over 30 languages.  You can read and download the Scrum Guide here.

While there are many other sources for information about Scrum, the Scrum Guide is a canonical reference and it's extremely well executed. For these reasons, we are using it as a primary source of material for defining CSE's approach to Scrum. Additional source material is referenced when elaboration is appropriate.
