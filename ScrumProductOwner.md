## Qualifications

What does it take to be a product owner? Here are typical traits:

* **Leadership:** Successful product owners are leaders who are able to effectivley communicate, build consensus, and make decisions in collaboration with business stakeholders and the engineering teams.

* **Trusted:** Product owners can only be effective when they earn trust from the customer, the development team and other stakeholders, such as engineering leaders. Trust is necessary for all stakeholders to have confidence that the PO is accurately representing a customer's requirements, prioritizing the backlog properly, identifying asnd remediating risks appropriately, etc.

* **Customer expertise:** Product owners need deep understanding of a customer's business goals, problems and constraints. The PO also needs a close relationship with decision makers at customers to work through issues and make decisions.

* **Backlogging skill:** Understanding and framing customer business goals in terms that are understandable and actionable by an engineering team is a complex task that typcially takes many years of experience to master. A correctly crafted backlog defines user stories in an implementation free manner that provides Dev Teams with the flexibility to independently design a solution that satisfies the stories.

* **Engineering & technical expertise:** Product owners need to understand both how engineering teams and projects work. Engineering experience helps POs understand what the different stakeholders need to know, and what concerns they are likely to have. Technical expertise is invaluable in terms of effectively participating in conversatations, understanding the sorts of issues that need to be addressed, and understanding the flexibility, contstraints and risks related to using a particular technology or architectural approach.

## Time Commitment
It is generally agreed that Product Owner is a full-time job during the entire lifespan of a project.

A common misunderstanding is that a Product Owner's primary focus is the upfront planning related to gathering customer requirements, defining a product vision and defining the backlog. While these are critical tasks, Product Owners can expect to be continuously engaged discussing issues, identifying and resolving issues, answering questions, making decisions about what to add, cut or change, communicating progress, etc.

## Best Practices

Effective Scrum Product Owners focus on the following:

* Identifying key project stakeholders, especially key influencers and decision makers.

* Defining implementation-free problem statements that clearly outline the problems that need to be solved during the project.

* Establishing measurable success criteria that reflects the things that must be achieved in order for the project to be considered successful.

* Creating and updating a prioritized backlog that captures the key business scenarios and user stories that need to be completed to in order achieve the success criteria.

* Collaborating with the Development team to assure that all backlog items are clearly understood and actionable, supporting sprint planning discussions, responding to questions, helping indentify and resolve issues, etc.

* Identifying and prioritizing project risks, and driving discussions on how to mitigate those risks.
