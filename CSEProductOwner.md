# Product Ownership in Microsoft's Commercial Software Engineering team

CSE uses Scrum as its software engineering process, and a CSE Product Owner fullfills all of the normal Scrum Product Owner responsibilities.

In addition, CSE has a unique business model in which we collaboratively defined and execute projects with a wide range of customers, and we've developed a standard set of artifacts, best practices and terminology to support this model.

This page summarizes how Product Onwership is tailored to fit the CSE business model.

## Identifying key stakeholders and influencers

Scrum Product Owners are always expected to identify key stakeholders and influencers. In CSE, this means:

* Customer engineering leaders and engineers.

* Customer executives who are sponsoring the engineering team with whom we are collaborating.

* Other customer teams/individuals who can impact successful completion of the project. For example, many customers have central cloud IT teams that control access to Azure subscriptions or the creation of Service Principle Names (SPNs), or security and compliance teams that must approve archiecture and/or production deployments.

* CSE stakeholders from CTE, including the on-point SE/I, SE/I lead and industry team leaders.

* Dev Crews stakeholders, including the Tech Lead, developers and TPM(s) from both general purpose teams, Tech Domain teams, and shared services teams (e.g. Machine Leaerning, DevOps).

* Account team contacts and roles. Every customer has a unique mix of account team stakeholders with a variety of skillsets, and it's important to identify the role each account team member fills with the customer.

* Relevant contacts from the Azure product teams and other Azure teams, such as Azure Global.

## Artifacts

 identifying key people at the customer, in CTE, 

Stakeholder Map	Game Plan Artifact	Envisioning, ADS, Game Planning		List of key participants (internal/external) in the engagement, their roles (formal and informal) on the project, expectations for involvement and communication

Problem Statements	Game Plan Artifact	Envisioning, ADS, Game Planning		One or more statements clearly articulating the essential problem(s) that the milestone must address to be declared a success.  Uses implementation-free, non-ambiguous language that minimizes potential for different interpretations.

Success Criteria (engagement)	Game Plan Artifact	Envisioning, ADS, Game Planning		Statements that must be true by the close of the engagement in order for the engagement to be considered as a "success".  Includes "success" as defined by the customer as well as Microsoft (i.e., meeting CSE standards for quality engineering that can be successfully handed over to customer engineers).  Success criteria also include any customer-imposed technical, time or procedural constraints that must be observed in planning and executing the project.

Definition of Done (milestone)	Game Plan Artifact	Envisioning, ADS, Game Planning		SMART criteria considered as essential to achieve a "minimum viable product" in the current milestone.  These will be derived from the success criteria for the engagement and often include specific measurable targets to ensure that MVP engineering requirements are fulfilled.

Risk Register*	Game Plan Artifact	Envisioning, ADS, Game Planning		Continually updated and prioritized list of risks that should be monitored and managed to ensure that the agreed scope of work (definition of done, success criteria) can be fulfilled within the anticipated time and resource constraints.  Also includes intangible and indirect risks such as those related to customer relationship/trust building and potential for follow-on engagement(s) with the account.  In addition to a continually-updated list of risks, the Risk Register should indicate the likelihood, severity and mitigation approach specific to each risk.

MVP Backlog: Epics	Game Plan Artifact	ADS, Game Planning		High-level solution elements act as containers for user stories.  Each epic should define a cluster of functional and non-functional capabilities that are required to enable a full end-to-end sub-scenario or functional sub-component that is part of the MVP.

MVP Backlog: User Stories	Game Plan Artifact	ADS, Game Planning		User stories that capture the key use cases for the epic under which they fall.  Although high-level, user stories are precise with regard to target persona ("As a..."), the general insight or activity that the story enables ("...I can..."), and the benefit that the insight or activity should deliver for the persona (..."so that...").

Stakeholder Management	Team Activity	Game Planing, Sprints		

Risk Management*	Team Activity	Game Planing, Sprints		

Backlog Grooming	Team Activity	Game Planing, Sprints		Adding, breaking down/combining user stories, detailing and stack ranking user stories.

Sprint/Milestone Reviews	Team Activity	Sprints	P	Under Kanban, may not be a "sprint" per se, but a chosen cadence.

Sprint/Milestone Retrospectives	Team Activity	Sprints	P	Under Kanban, may not be a "sprint" per se, but a chosen cadence.
 				
Product Feedback	Project Closeout Artifact	Sprints		Consider dropping:  if it's short, the team should just do it; if it's longer, it's a story and the PO will get it into the backlog and treat it like any other story
