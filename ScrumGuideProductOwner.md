# Product Owner as defined by The Scrum Guide

[The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide) defines the Product Owner as follows:

>The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.
>
>The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:
>
>* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
>* Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
>* Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
>* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
>* Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.
>
>The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.
>
>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item's priority must address the Product Owner.
>
>For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner's decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.

## Product Owner role during a sprint

The Scrum Guide defines several Product Owner responsibilities during the [Sprint](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-sprint), including the following:

>During the Sprint... Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

>A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master...
>
>If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.

## Product Owner role during Sprint Planning

Product Owner responsbilities during planning, according to the Scrum Guide, include:

>**Topic One: What can be done during this sprint?**
>
>The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.

>**Topic Two: how will the chosen work get done?**
>
>The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs. If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner. The Development Team may also invite other people to attend to provide technical or domain advice.
>
>By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

>**Sprint Goal**
>
>As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

## Sprint Review/Demo

Scrum Guide on PO responsibilities during the [Sprint Review/Demo](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-review):

>**Sprint Review**
>
A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and [adjust] the Product Backlog if needed...
>
>The Sprint Review includes the following elements:
>
>* Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;
>* The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done";
>* The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;
The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment;
>* The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);
>* Etc.
